## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ayush Kamath, a passionate Computer Science major at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) and an enthusiastic developer focused on cloud computing and data analysis. As an international student who completed my elementary school in the United States and secondary school with international curricula in India, I bring a diverse perspective to my work, combining academic knowledge with hands-on experience in the tech industry.

ðŸ”¹  My interest in programming originated from a Scratch summer bootcamp hosted by my local library. I learned about loops and variables in game development, which captivated my interest and revealed the broader scope of programming applications.

ðŸ”¹ I recently completed an externship with Extern, where I researched and analyzed smart contract vulnerabilities, collaborated on data validation, and visualized refined datasets using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scri.py, and Seaborn.

ðŸ”¹ I'm preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) exam and developed a Python-based Discord bot, deployed on Replit, to aid my preparation. The bot features an interactive quiz system that delivers AWS-related questions and evaluates user responses, enhancing learning through real-time feedback. I'm continually improving its functionality and exploring ways to keep it running smoothly.

ðŸ”¹ As the Secretary of MTSU's ACM club, I am actively involved in organizing university tech events, I constantly seek opportunities to collaborate and contribute to MTSU's tech community.

ðŸ”¹ As part of the winning team at MTSU's annual hackathon, HackMT, my team created software to detect overcharges in medical insurance bills.

ðŸ”¹ I have part-time experience working for my university's Computer Science Department as a Lab Worker and desk assistant.

ðŸ”¹ I acquired a license and organized the first TEDx event (TEDxYouth@CandorIntlSchool) for my high school when I was 17.
